module WebAudio where

{-| A module for accessing the Web Audio API via Elm.

# Getting Started

First, you will need an `AudioContext`. There are two types of contexts:
a standard context (which outputs to the user's audio device - speakers,
headphones, etc), and an "offline" context which renders audio to a buffer.
It is fairly rare that you would need more than one standard context, and, so
this library provides a convenience context called the `DefaultContext`. Think
of the `DefaultContext` as a singleton for a standard context.

I highly recommend you read through the Web Audio API documentation to
familiarize yourself with the concepts. You can find the documentation here:
http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/

@docs AudioContext, createContext, createOfflineContext, getSampleRate, getCurrentTime

# Special Notes

Most "set" functions take the object whose value is being set as the last
parameter, and then the function returns that same object to facilitate
function chaining using the "|>" operator.

# Audio Params

Most parameters for various Audio Nodes are actually "AudioParams". These
allow you to either set a constant value, or schedule changes to the value at
appropriate times. All times are relative to the AudioContext's current time.
If you try to schedule a change for a time that has already passed, the change
will take effect immediately.

The documentation below will note if the node has any AudioParams that you can
modify in the form of a bulleted list. These params can be accessed using the
record notation. For example, a Biquad Filter Node has a "frequency" param. It
could be accessed with: `node.frequency`

@docs AudioParam, setValue, getValue, setValueAtTime, linearRampToValue, exponentialRampToValue, setTargetAtTime, setValueCurveAtTime, cancelScheduledValues

# Audio Buffers

An `AudioBuffer` stores audio data in memory in a PCM format with a range of
-1 to 1. AudioBuffers may contain multiple channels. Typically, AudioBuffers
are used for "short" audio clips (less than a minute) because the entire file
must be loaded before the audio can be played. An HTMLMediaElement, such as
the HTML `audio` tag handled by the MediaElementAudioSourceNode, is typically
used for longer audio clips because it supports streaming.

There are many ways to create AudioBuffers, some of which are beyond the scope
of this library. However, this library does have a few functions available to
load audio files into buffers. If you have a need to create an AudioBuffer in a
way this library does not directly support, the Native library contains a
function called `createAudioBuffer` that takes an AudioBuffer and returns an
AudioBuffer compatible with this library.

@docs AudioBuffer, getBufferSampleRate, getBufferLength, getBufferDuration, getBufferNumberOfChannels, getChannelData, getChannelDataSlice, setChannelDataSlice

# Audio Nodes

Once you have your AudioContext, you can begin to build your graph of Audio
Nodes.

* release

@docs DynamicsCompressorNode, createDynamicsCompressorNode

# Gain Nodes

Gain Nodes have the following AudioParams:

@docs GainNode, createGainNode

# Media Element Audio Source Nodes

Media Element Audio Source Nodes connect HTMLMediaElements to the audio graph.
This is the preferred way to connect a "long" audio file to the audio graph.
HTMLMediaElements are things like the HTML video or audio tags, and creating
these tags is a bit beyond the scope of this library. However, this library
does have a convenience method for creating a "hidden" audio tag that will not
be added to the page, but will load an audio file via the HTMLMediaElement
interface thus gaining the benefits of streaming, etc.

The Native library also includes a function called `createMediaElementSourceNode`
that takes an instance of HTMLMediaElement (which you might get from doing a
`document.getElementById()` or from creating an element with `document.createElement`)
and returns a MediaElementAudioSourceNode. You could use this in your own code
to create a MediaElementAudioSourceNode from an audio (or video) tag that you
have created using other means.

unless there's some reason you need to have more than one context.

fields:

  Context has finished rendering audio to the AudioBuffer
-}

{-| AudioNodes

AudioNodes make up the building blocks of your audio signal graph. There are
source nodes which produce an audio stream, destination nodes which can create
sound from the stream, and processing nodes which allow you to modify the
stream such as filters, delays, and effects.

Audio Nodes have the following properties:
  * inputs: The number of inputs for this node. 0 means this is a source node.
  * outputs: The number of outputs for this node. 0 means this is a destination
    node.
-}

{-| Connect Audio Nodes

An output of node1 will be connected to an input of node2. You may specify the
index of the output to connect, and the index of the input. These indexes are
zero based. Fan-in and fan-out are both supported, so the output of a node can
be connected to multiple nodes, and multiple nodes can be connected to a single
input. This function will return node1 for chaining.
-}
connectNodes : AudioNode b -> Int -> Int -> AudioNode a -> AudioNode a
connectNodes = Native.WebAudio.connectNodes

{-| Connect an Audio Node to an Audio Param

The signal from an AudioNode may be fed into an AudioParam to control the
parameter value. You may also specify which output index to connect. The index
is zero based. Fan-in and fan-out are both supported, so the output of a node
can be connected to multiple AudioParams, and multiple AudioParams can be
connected to a single node. This function will return the node for chaining.
-}
connectToParam : AudioParam b -> Int -> AudioNode a -> AudioNode a
connectToParam = Native.WebAudio.connectToParam

{-| Get a Node's Channel Count

The number of channels used when up-mixing or down-mixing inputs. The default
is 2 for most nodes, but some nodes determine this based on other settings. If
the node has no inputs, this setting has no effect.

getChannelCount = Native.WebAudio.getChannelCount

{-| Set a Node's Channel Count

The number of channels used when up-mixing or down-mixing inputs. The default

{-| Get a Node's Channel Interpretation
@docs ChannelInterpretation
-}
getChannelInterpretation : AudioNode a -> ChannelInterpretation
getChannelInterpretation = Native.WebAudio.getChannelInterpretation

{-| Set a Node's Channel Interpretation - returns the node itself for chaining.
@docs ChannelInterpretation
-}
setChannelInterpretation : ChannelInterpretation -> AudioNode a -> AudioNode a
setChannelInterpretation = Native.WebAudio.setChannelInterpretation

{-| "Tap" a node

This is a convenience function, making it easy to access one of the node's
AudioParam properties and then return the node itself at the end so you can
continue to chain more functions.

For example, if "node" is an OscillatorNode:

```haskell
tapNode .frequency (\f -> setValue 440.0 f) node |> startOscillator 0.0
```
-}
tapNode : (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> a -> a
tapNode f t n =
  let _ = t <| f n
  in n

oscillator is essentially useless. The system is supposed to automatically clean
up AudioNodes that are no longer in use, provided that the node meets a couple
requirements - one of which is that there are no more references to it.
Therefore, Elm.WebAudio will automatically free the reference to the underlying
javascript object as soon as a stop has been scheduled. What this means, from a
practical standpoint, is that any further attempt to manipulate the Oscillator
will result in a javascript error. It's not pretty, but, honestly, neither is
the WebAudio Javascript API.
